## 4. Questions Examples

Here is the set of **sample questions** that the agent should be able to handle, such as:

- “How many orders were placed in the last 7 days?”
- “Which products sold the most last month?”
- “Show a table of revenue by city.”
- “Who are my repeat customers?”
- “What is the AOV (Average Order Value) trend this month?”
- “Can you recommend what product to promote based on sales?”
- (Bonus) “Plot a graph of order volume over the past 4 weeks.”

## 5. Expectations and Constraints

- The agent must not generate or execute POST, PUT, or DELETE requests.
- All data fetching must go through your custom `get_shopify_data` tool.
- All data analysis must be performed using `PythonREPLAst`.
- Agent should **not emit raw code** in the response.
- Handle pagination, 429 rate limiting, and malformed API responses gracefully.
