The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# REST Admin API reference

The Admin API lets you build apps and integrations that extend and enhance the Shopify admin.

Some newer platform features may only be available in [GraphQL](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql).

## Client libraries

Use Shopify’s officially supported libraries to build fast, reliable apps with the programming languages and frameworks you already know.

##### cURL

Use the [curl utility](https://curl.se/) to make API queries directly from the command line.

##### Remix

The official package for Remix applications, with full TypeScript support.

* [Docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix)
* [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix)
* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/apps/shopify-app-remix#readme)

##### Node.js

The official client library for Node.js applications, with full TypeScript support. It has no framework dependencies, so it can be used by any Node.js app.

* [Docs](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/apps/shopify-api#readme)
* [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-api)
* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/apps/shopify-api)

##### Ruby

The official client library for Ruby apps.

* [Docs](https://shopify.github.io/shopify-api-ruby/)

* [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/shopify_api)

* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby)

##### Other

##### cURL

```bash
# cURL is often available by default on macOS and Linux.
#
# See http://curl.se/docs/install.html for more details.
```

##### Remix

```ts
npm install --save @shopify/shopify-app-remix
# or
yarn add @shopify/shopify-app-remix
```

##### Node.js

```ts
npm install --save @shopify/shopify-api
# or
yarn add @shopify/shopify-api
```

##### Ruby

```ruby
bundle add shopify_api
```

***

## Authentication

All REST Admin API queries require a valid Shopify access token.

Public and custom apps created in the Dev Dashboard generate tokens using [OAuth](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth), and custom apps made in the Shopify admin are [authenticated in the Shopify admin](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/admin-app-access-tokens). To simplify the authentication process, use one of the recommended Shopify client libraries.

Include your token as a `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header on all API queries. Using Shopify’s supported [client libraries](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/api-libraries) can simplify this process.

To keep the platform secure, apps need to request specific [access scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) during the install process. Only request as much data access as your app needs to work.

Learn more about [getting started with authentication](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth) and [building apps](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started).

##### cURL

```bash
curl -X GET \ https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-10/shop.json \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Shopify-Access-Token: {password}'
```

##### Remix

```ts
const { admin } = await authenticate.admin(request);
const response = admin.rest.get({path: 'shop'});
```

##### Node.js

```ts
const client = new shopify.clients.Rest({session});
const response = client.get({path: 'shop'});
```

##### Ruby

```ruby
session = ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session.new(
  shop: 'your-development-store.myshopify.com',
  access_token: access_token,
)

ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(
  api_key: 'client_id',
  api_secret_key: 'client_secret',
  api_version: 'api_version', # Example: '2025-10'
  scope: 'read_products',
  is_private: false, # Set to true if you are using a private app
  is_embedded: true # Set to true if you are using an embedded app
)

ShopifyAPI::Context.activate_session(session)

client = ShopifyAPI::Clients::Rest::Admin.new(
  session: session
)
response = client.get(path: 'shop')
```

## Endpoints and requests

Admin REST API endpoints are organized by resource type. You’ll need to use different endpoints depending on your app’s requirements.

All Admin REST API endpoints follow this pattern:

`https://{store_name}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-10/{resource}.json`

##### POSTExample POST request

Create a new product.

This example illustrates how to create a new product using the Product resource and the `/admin/api/2025-10/products.json` endpoint. Replace `{store_name}` with your store’s domain and `{access_token}` with the access token you generated in the Authentication section.

##### GETExample GET request

Retrieve a single product.

This example illustrates how to retrieve information for a single product using the Product resource and the `admin/api/2025-10/products/{product_id}.json` endpoint. Replace `{store_name}` with your store’s domain and `{access_token}` with the access token you generated in the Authentication section.

##### PUTExample PUT request

Update a product.

This example illustrates how to update a product using the Product resource and the `admin/api/2025-10/products/{product_id}.json` endpoint. Replace `{store_name}` with your store’s domain and `{access_token}` with the access token you generated in the Authentication section.

##### DELExample DELETE request

Delete a product.

This example illustrates how to delete a product using the Product resource and the `admin/api/2025-10/products/{product_id}.json` endpoint. Replace `{store_name}` with your store’s domain and `{access_token}` with the access token you generated in the Authentication section.

The Admin API is versioned, with new releases four times per year. To keep your app stable, make sure you specify a supported version in the URL. Learn more about [API versioning](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning).

All REST endpoints support [cursor-based pagination](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/pagination-rest). All requests produce HTTP [response status codes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/response-codes).

Learn more about [API usage](https://shopify.dev/api/usage).

***

## Rate limits

The REST Admin API supports a limit of 40 requests per app per store per minute. This allotment replenishes at a rate of 2 requests per second. The rate limit is increased by a factor of 10 for Shopify Plus stores.

### Usage limitations

REST Admin API supports a limit of **40 requests per app per store per minute**.

Past the limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

All REST API responses include the `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit` header, which shows how many requests the client has made, and the total number allowed per minute.

A `429` response will also include a `Retry-After` header with the number of seconds to wait until retrying your query.

Learn more about [rate limits](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/limits#rest-admin-api-rate-limits).

## {} Header

X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit: 40/40

Retry-After: 2.0

***

#### 403 Forbidden

The server is refusing to respond. This is typically caused by incorrect [access scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes).

***

#### 404 Not Found

The requested resource was not found but could be available again in the future.

***

#### 422 Unprocessable Entity

The request body contains semantic errors. This is typically caused by incorrect formatting, omitting required fields, or logical errors such as initiating a checkout for an out-of-stock product.

***

#### 429 Too Many Requests

The client has exceeded the [rate limit](#rate-limits).

***

#### 5xx Errors

An internal error occurred in Shopify. Check out the [Shopify status page](https://www.shopifystatus.com) for more information.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Abandoned checkouts

Requires `orders` access scope.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

You can use the [Abandoned checkouts](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/abandoned-checkouts#resource_object) resource to retrieve a list and a count of abandoned checkouts. A checkout is considered abandoned after the customer has added contact information, but before the customer has completed their purchase.

This resource may be helpful to complete the following actions:

* Gather marketing information on customers who have abandoned their cart.
* Use information to remarket to abandoned checkout customers.
* Understand customers’ behavior.
* Track abandoned checkouts over time.
* View abandoned checkout items.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Application​Charge

The ApplicationCharge resource facilitates one-time charges. This type of charge is recommended for apps that aren’t billed on a recurring basis. You can create an application charge by sending a request with the name the charge should appear under, the price your app is charging, and a return URL where Shopify redirects the merchant after the charge is accepted. After you've created the charge, redirect the merchant to the confirmation URL returned by Shopify. If the charge is declined, then Shopify redirects the merchant and provides a notification message that the app charge was declined.

Note

For testing purposes you can include `"test": true` when creating the charge. This prevents the credit card from being charged. Test shops and demo shops can't be charged.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Application​Credit

Important

Creating application credits through this resource is being deprecated. App credits can continue to be created using the [appCreditCreate mutation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/partner/unstable/mutations/appCreditCreate) in the Partner API.

The ApplicationCredit resource is used to issue credits to merchants that can be used towards future app purchases in Shopify. You can create an application credit by sending a request that includes the credit amount and a description explaining the reason for the credit. A corresponding deduction based on your revenue share is entered in your Partner account by Shopify. For example, if you create a credit for $10.00, then a deduction of $8.00 is applied.

The total amount of all application credits requested by an app must not exceed the total amount the shop owner was charged in the last 30 days, or the total amount of pending payouts in the app's Partner account.

Note

The ApplicationCredit resource can be used only by apps that use Shopify's Billing API ([ApplicationCharge](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/billing/applicationcharge), [RecurringApplicationCharge](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/billing/recurringapplicationcharge), or [UsageCharge](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/billing/usagecharge)).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Article

Requires `content` access scope.

The Article resource allows your app to create, publish, and edit articles on a shop's blog. Articles belong to a single blog, and can have any number of comments.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Asset

Requires `themes` access scope.

Note

Starting with Admin API 2023-04, if an app distributed through the Shopify App Store uses the Asset resource to create, edit or delete a theme's asset, you need to request the required protected access scope. In most cases, you shouldn't use the Asset resource. To learn more about when you can use the Asset resource, and how to migrate, refer to the [Asset resource](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/online-store/other-integration-methods/asset).

Theme assets are the individual files that make up a shop's theme.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/asset.png)

A theme's assets include its templates, images, stylesheets, and extra snippets of code. They are arranged among the theme's directories, such as **layout**, **templates**, and **assets**. You can use the Asset resource to add, change, or remove asset files from a shop's theme. For a complete list of theme directories, refer to [*Theme architecture*](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture).

To learn how to create your own theme, see [*Building themes*](https://shopify.dev/concepts/themes).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Assigned​Fulfillment​Order

Requires `assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope.

A list of all the [fulfillment orders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder) that are assigned to an app at the shop level. The list of fulfillment orders can be filtered by [location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) and assignment status.

Assigned fulfillment orders are fulfillment orders that are set to be fulfilled from locations managed by [fulfillment services](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) that are registered by the app. One app (api\_client) may host multiple fulfillment services on a shop. Each fulfillment service manages a dedicated location on a shop. Assigned fulfillment orders can have associated [fulfillment requests](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentrequest) or might currently not be requested to be fulfilled.

Retrieves a list of fulfillment orders assigned to the shop locations that are owned by the app.

The app must have the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) to be able to retrieve fulfillment orders assigned to its locations.

All assigned fulfillment orders (except those with the `CLOSED` status) will be returned by default. Perform filtering with the `assignment_status` query parameter to receive only fulfillment orders that have been requested to be fulfilled.

### Parameters

# Blog

Requires `content` access scope.

In addition to an online storefront, Shopify shops come with a built-in blogging engine, allowing a shop to have one or more blogs.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/blog.png)

Shop owners are encouraged to use blogs to:

* Make announcements
* Talk about their products in more detail
* Show off their expertise
* Connect with their customers and
* Boost their shop's search engine rankings

Shopify blogs are like most other blogs: a content management system for articles posted in reverse chronological order. Articles can be posted under one or more user-defined categories and tagged with one or more user-defined tags, with an option to allow readers to post comments to articles. An Atom feed is automatically generated for each blog, allowing for syndication. The search functionality built into every shop also searches the text in blog articles.

Blogs are meant to be used as a type of magazine or newsletter for the shop, with content that changes over time. If your shop needs a static page (such as an "About Us" page), we recommend that you use a Page instead.

Also see the [Article resource](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/online-store/article) for managing blog articles.

### Properties

***

commentable

->[commentPolicy](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Blog#field-Blog.fields.commentPolicy)

Indicates whether readers can post comments to the blog and if comments are moderated or not. Possible values are:

Show commentable properties

* **no (default)**: Readers cannot post comments to blog articles.
* **moderate**: Readers can post comments to blog articles, but comments must be moderated before they appear.
* **yes**: Readers can post comments to blog articles without moderation.

***

created\_at

read-only

->[createdAt](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Blog#field-Blog.fields.createdAt)

The date and time when the blog was created. The API returns this value in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

***

feedburner

->[path](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BlogFeed#field-BlogFeed.fields.path)

FeedBurner is a web feed management provider and can be enabled to provide custom RSS feeds for Shopify bloggers. Google has stopped supporting FeedBurner, and new or existing blogs that are not already integrated with FeedBurner can't use the service. This property will default to blank unless FeedBurner is enabled.

***

feedburner\_location

->[location](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BlogFeed#field-BlogFeed.fields.location)

The URL that points to the FeedBurner location for blogs that have FeedBurner enabled. Google has stopped supporting FeedBurner, and new or existing blogs that are not already integrated with FeedBurner can't use the service. This property will default to blank unless FeedBurner is enabled

handle

->[handle](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Blog#field-Blog.fields.handle)

A human-friendly unique string that is automatically generated from the title if no handle is sent during the creation of a blog. Duplicate handles are appended with an incremental number, for example, `blog-2`. The handle is customizable and is used by the Liquid templating language to refer to the blog. If you change the handle of a blog, then it can negatively affect the SEO of the shop. We recommend that you create a URL redirect to avoid any SEO issues.

***

A human-friendly unique string that is automatically generated from the title if no handle is sent during the creation of a blog. Duplicate handles are appended with an incremental number, for example, `blog-2`. The handle is customizable and is used by the Liquid templating language to refer to the blog. If you change the handle of a blog, then it can negatively affect the SEO of the shop. We recommend that you create a URL redirect to avoid any SEO issues.

Indicates whether readers can post comments to the blog and if comments are moderated or not. Possible values are:

* **moderate**: Readers can post comments to blog articles, but comments must be moderated before they appear.
* **yes**: Readers can post comments to blog articles without moderation.

  Manage the cancellation request flow of fulfillment orders assigned to
  fulfillment services.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Cancellation​Request

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

The `CancellationRequest` resource represents a cancellation request made by the merchant or an order management app to a [fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillmentservice) for a [fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillmentorder). A fulfillment service can accept or reject the cancellation request.

## Retrieving cancellation request details

The `FulfillmentOrder` resource and the `merchant_requests` field can be used to retrieve the merchant requests which have been made. The overall status of these requests is also available using the `request_status` field of the fulfillment order.

To learn more about the cancellation request process in the fulfillment workflow, refer to [Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments) guide.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Carrier​Service

Requires `shipping` access scope.

A carrier service (also known as a carrier calculated service or shipping service) provides real-time shipping rates to Shopify. Some common carrier services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term **carrier** is often used interchangeably with the terms **shipping company** and **rate provider**.

Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on what is in the customer's cart.

## Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource

To access the CarrierService resource, add the `write_shipping` permission to your app's requested scopes. For more information, see [*API access scopes*](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).

Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements:

* It's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.
* It's on the Shopify plan with yearly billing, or the carrier service feature has been added to the store for a monthly fee. For more information, contact [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/questions).
* It's a development store.

Note

If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the requirements above.

## Providing shipping rates to Shopify

When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint rooted in the `callback_url` property where Shopify can retrieve applicable shipping rates. The callback URL should be a public endpoint that expects these requests from Shopify.

**A sample Shopify request for shipping rates:**

```
POST
```

Your callback URL

Retrieves a list of applicable shipping rates

The `address3`, `fax`, `address_type`, and `company_name` fields are returned by specific [ActiveShipping](https://github.com/Shopify/active_shipping) providers. For API-created carrier services, you should use only the following shipping address fields:

* `address1`
* `address2`
* `city`
* `zip`
* `province`
* `country`

Other values remain as `null` and are not sent to the callback URL.

### Response fields

When Shopify requests shipping rates using your callback URL, the response object `rates` must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields. Required fields must be included in the response for the carrier service integration to work properly.

| | |
| - | - |
| **Field** | **Description** |
| `service_name` required | The name of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: `Expedited Mail`. |
| `description` required | A description of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: `Includes tracking and insurance`. |
| `service_code` required | A unique code associated with the rate. For example: `expedited_mail.` |
| `currency` required | The currency of the shipping rate. |
| `total_price` required | The total price expressed in subunits. If the currency doesn't use subunits, then the value must be multiplied by 100. For example: \`"total\_price": 500\` for 5.00 CAD, \`"total\_price": 100000\` for 1000 JPY. |
| `phone_required` | Whether the customer must provide a phone number at checkout. |
| `min_delivery_date` | The earliest delivery date for the displayed rate. |
| `max_delivery_date` | The latest delivery date for the displayed rate to still be valid. |

### Special conditions

* To indicate that this carrier service cannot handle this shipping request, return an empty array and any successful (20x) HTTP code.
* To force backup rates instead, return a 40x or 50x HTTP code with any content. A good choice is the regular 404 Not Found code.
* Redirects (30x codes) will only be followed for the same domain as the original callback URL. Attempting to redirect to a different domain will trigger backup rates.
* There is no retry mechanism. The response must be successful on the first try, within the time budget listed below. Timeouts or errors will trigger backup rates.

## Response Timeouts

The read timeout for rate requests are dynamic, based on the number of requests per minute (RPM). These limits are applied to each shop-app pair. The timeout values are as follows.

| | |
| - | - |
| **RPM Range** | **Timeout** |
| Under 1500 | 10s |
| 1500 to 3000 | 5s |
| Over 3000 | 3s |

**Note: **These values are upper limits and should not be interpretted as a goal to develop towards. Shopify is constantly evaluating the performance of the platform and working towards improving resilience as well as app capabilities. As such, these numbers may be adjusted outside of our normal versioning timelines.

## Server-side caching of requests

Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of requests it makes. Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:

* variant IDs
* default shipping box weight and dimensions
* variant quantities
* carrier service ID
* origin address
* destination address
* item weights and signatures

If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original request, then new shipping rates are requested. The cache expires 15 minutes after rates are successfully returned. If an error occurs, then the cache expires after 30 seconds.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Checkout

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

Important

The REST Checkout API is deprecated as of version 2024-07. Please see the [developer changelog](https://shopify.dev/changelog/deprecation-of-checkout-apis) for more information.

If you're building an app with the [Sales Channel SDK](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/channels), then you can use the Checkout API to let customers purchase products from Shopify stores that have installed your sales channel.

Shopify uses the Checkout resource to manage a user's cart as it transitions to a paid order. This process includes specifying which line items are included in the checkout, attaching a customer's shipping and payment details, and calculating tax and shipping rates. Credit card payments can be attached to a Checkout using the [Payment](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/payment) resource.

#### Note

You can't use the Checkout API to create a new checkout user experience for an individual store. For that you need to use an SDK that's powered by the [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront) instead, such as the [JavaScript Buy](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/additional-sdks/js-buy), [iOS Buy](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/mobile-kit/buy-sdk-ios), and [Android Buy](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/mobile-kit/buy-sdk-android) SDKs.

## getRetrieves a list of shipping ratesdeprecated

Retrieves a list of available shipping rates for the specified checkout. Implementers need to poll this endpoint until rates become available.

Each shipping rate contains the checkout's new subtotal price, total tax, and total price in the event that this shipping rate is selected. This can be used to update the UI without performing further API requests.To apply a shipping rate, update the checkout's shipping line with the handle of the selected rate.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Collect

Requires `products` access scope.

The Collect resource connects a product to a custom collection.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/collect.png)

Collects are meant for managing the relationship between products and custom collections. For every product in a custom collection there is a collect that tracks the ID of both the product and the custom collection. A product can be in more than one collection, and will have a collect connecting it to each collection. Unlike many Shopify resources, collects aren't apparent to store owners.

Collects are for placing products in custom collections only. [Smart collections](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/smartcollection) use rules to determine which products are their members. Creating a collect that links a product to a smart collection results in a **403 Forbidden** error.

For more information on custom collections, see the [CustomCollection](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/customcollection) resource.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Collection

Requires `products` access scope.

A collection is a grouping of products that merchants can create to make their stores easier to browse. For example, a merchant might create a collection for a specific type of product that they sell, such as **Footwear**. Merchants can create collections by selecting products individually or by defining rules that automatically determine whether products are included.

Shopify stores start with a single collection, called **Frontpage**. This is a collection of products that are shown on the front page of the online store.

There are two different types of collection:

* **Custom collections**, which contain products that are manually added to a collection by a merchant. For more information, see the [CustomCollection](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/customcollection) resource.
* **Smart collections**, which contain products that are automatically added based on selection conditions that a merchant chooses. For more information, see the [SmartCollection](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/smartcollection) resource.

The [Collect](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/collect) resource is used to connect a product to a [custom collection](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/customcollection).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Collection​Listing

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

A `CollectionListing` resource represents a [product collection](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections) that a merchant has made available to your sales channel. Merchants can make collections available to your sales channel directly from their Shopify admin.

You can use this resource to retrieve collections that a merchant has published and display them in your marketplace. You can also retrieve a list of published product IDs that belong to a published collection.

Only sales channels can publish collections using the REST Admin API. You can't publish collections and make them available to non-sales channels apps using the REST Admin API.

Note:

When a merchant makes a collection available to your app, the products belonging to that collection are not automatically made available. The merchant must make both the collection and each product available to your sales channel.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Comment

Requires `content` access scope.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

A comment is a reader's response to an article in a blog. Comments appear on the article page in reverse chronological order, typically after the article body. Just as a blog can have any number of articles, an article can have any number of comments.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/comment.png)

Article comments are a target for spammers, so Shopify blogs use a spam detection system to identify comments that are likely to be spam. Shop owners can also can mark comments as spam or not spam. Comments that are marked as spam are removed from the Shopify admin and don't appear in the blog.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Country

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Important

The REST Country API is deprecated as of version 2024-07.

Please refer to the documentation for each individual endpoint and the [developer changelog](https://shopify.dev/changelog/deprecation-notice-country-and-province-endpoints-in-admin-rest-api) for more information.

The Country resource represents the tax rates applied to orders from the different countries where a shop sells its products.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/country.png)

Merchants select the countries where they sell their products when they set up their shipping zones and rates on the **Shipping** page of the Shopify admin. After adding a country to a shipping zone, store owners can then verify and adjust tax rates for each country on the **Taxes** page.

The Country resource lets you access the countries and tax rates set up by the merchant. The countries list includes a default entry called **Rest of World**, which represents all non-specified countries.

You can use the Country resource to modify the sales tax rate for a country or sub-region to account for surtaxes or exemptions that apply to the store.

For more information on managing tax rates for sub-regions of a country, such as states or provinces, see the [Province](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/store-properties/province) resource.

Caution

As of version 2020-10, you can no longer create or update custom tax values for the Country resource.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Currency

Merchants who use Shopify Payments can allow customers to pay in their local currency on the online store. When a customer selects a currency, all prices on the online store and checkout are automatically converted to that currency. Merchants enable the currencies that they want to offer to customers from their Shopify Payments settings.

The Currency resource represents a currency that the merchant has enabled. For each enabled currency, the Currency resource returns the currency code and the time when its conversion rate was last updated.

# Custom​Collection

Requires `products` access scope.

A custom collection is a grouping of products that a merchant can create to make their store easier to browse. The merchant creates a custom collection and then selects the products that will go into it.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/custom-collection.png)

Collections are typically displayed to customers so that buyers can select to view only the products in the collection. Shopify stores start with a single custom collection called frontpage—the collection of products shown on the front page of the online store.

The [Collect](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/collect) resource is used to connect a product to a custom collection.

There are also smart collections, which contain products based on selection conditions rather than because they've been included manually. For more information, see the [SmartCollection](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/smartcollection) resource.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Customer

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

The Customer resource stores information about a shop's customers, such as their contact details, their order history, and whether they've agreed to receive email marketing.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/customer.png)

The Customer resource also holds information on the status of a customer's account. Customers with accounts save time at checkout when they're logged in because they don't need to enter their contact information. You can use the Customer API to check whether a customer has an active account, and then invite them to create one if they don't.

For security reasons, the Customer resource doesn't store credit card information. Customers always need to enter this information at checkout.

In a shop's checkout settings, there are three options for customer accounts:

* **Accounts are disabled**: Customers can't create accounts and can check out only as guests.
* **Accounts are optional**: Customers have the choice of either signing into their account or checking out as a guest. Customers can create accounts for themselves, and the shop owner can create an account for a customer and then invite them by email to use it.
* **Accounts are required**: Customers can't check out unless they're logged in, and the shop owner must create their accounts.

Caution: Only use this data if it is necessary for the intended app functionality. Shopify retains the ability to restrict access to [API Access scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for apps not requiring legitimate use of the associated data.

## postCreates an account activation URL for a customer

[customerGenerateAccountActivationUrl](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/customerGenerateAccountActivationUrl?example=creates-an-account-activation-url-for-a-customer)

Requires `customers` access scope.

Generate an account activation URL for a customer whose account is not yet enabled. This is useful when you've imported a large number of customers and want to send them activation emails all at once. Using this approach, you'll need to generate and send the activation emails yourself.

The account activation URL generated by this endpoint is for one-time use and will expire after 30 days. If you make a new POST request to this endpoint, then a new URL will be generated. The new URL will be again valid for 30 days, but the previous URL will no longer be valid.

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

customer\_id

string

required

### Examples

Create an account activation URL for an invited or disabled customer

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Deprecated API calls

Custom apps

The Deprecated API calls resource is available only for [custom](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps#custom-apps) apps.

You can call this endpoint to get a list of all the deprecated calls your custom apps have made in the past 30 days, information on migration steps, and the deadline to update these calls in your apps.

Follow the [developer changelog](https://shopify.dev/changelog) to make sure you're aware of any breaking changes that might affect your app. You can learn more about how to update your apps in our [versioning guide](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning).

***

deprecated\_api\_calls

A list of deprecated API calls made by the authenticated app in the past 30 days. Each object has the following properties:

Show deprecated\_api\_calls properties

* `api_type`: The type of API that the call was made to. Valid values: `REST`, `Webhook`, `GraphQL`.
* `description`: A description of the deprecation and any required migration steps.
* `documentation_url`: The documentation URL to the deprecated change.
* `endpoint`: A description of the REST endpoint, webhook topic, or GraphQL field called.
* `last_call_at`: The timestamp ([ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format) when the last deprecated API call was made.
* `migration_deadline`: The time ([ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format) when the deprecated API call will be removed.
* `graphql_schema_name`: The name of the GraphQL schema. If the call wasn't made to a GraphQL API, then this value is `null`.
* `version`: The earliest API version to migrate to in order to avoid making the deprecated API calls.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Discount​Code

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Note

We recommend using the GraphQL Admin API to manage discounts. The [Discount types](https://shopify.dev/api/examples/discounts) available in the GraphQL Admin API are intended to replace the GraphQL Admin `PriceRule` object and REST Admin `PriceRule` and `DiscountCode` resources.

You can use the PriceRule DiscountCode resource to create discount codes that enable specific discounts to be redeemed. Merchants can distribute discount codes to their customers using a variety of means, such as an email or URL, and customers can apply these codes at checkout.

Each discount code belongs to a price rule, which holds the logic for the discount. For more information, see the [PriceRule](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/discounts/pricerule) resource.

To create multiple discount codes that use the same price rule logic, use the batch endpoint. For example, you might allow merchants to create a batch of discount codes that belong to the same price rule but are each personalized for a different customer.

## postCreates a discount code creation job

[discountRedeemCodeBulkAdd](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/discountRedeemCodeBulkAdd?example=creates-a-discount-code-creation-job)

Creates a discount code creation job.

The batch endpoint can be used to asynchronously create up to 100 discount codes in a single request. It enqueues and returns a `discount_code_creation` object that can be monitored for completion. You can enqueue a single creation job per a shop and you can't enqueue more until the job completes.

The `price_rule_id` path parameter is the ID of the price rule that the discount code will belong to. This is required because each discount code must belong to a price rule.

Response fields that are specific to the batch endpoint include:

* `status`: The state of the discount code creation job. Possible values are:

  * `queued`: The job is acknowledged, but not started.
  * `running`: The job is in process.
  * `completed`: The job has finished.

* `codes_count`: The number of discount codes to create.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Dispute

Requires ANY of the following access scopes: `shopify_payments_payouts`, `shopify_payments`.

Disputes occur when a buyer questions the legitimacy of a charge with their financial institution.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Draft​Order

Requires `draft_orders` access scope.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

Merchants can use draft orders to create orders on behalf of their customers. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:

* Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
* Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.
* Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't displayed in a shop's inventory.
* Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
* Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
* Take pre-orders.

Note

The Draft Order resource doesn't expose reserve inventory information.

**Caution:** Only use this data if it is necessary for the intended app functionality. Shopify retains the ability to restrict access to [API Access scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for apps not requiring legitimate use of the associated data.

## postCreate a new Draft​Order

[draftOrderCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderCreate)

Creates a draft order.

Using the `DraftOrder` resource you can create orders in draft state using product variant line items, or custom line items. To create a product variant draft order, provide the `variant_id`, `quantity` and `discount` properties. To create a custom line item, provide the `title`, `price`, `taxable`, and `quantity` properties.

Note

If you are using this endpoint with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can only create five draft orders per minute.

### Polling

When you create and update draft orders some calculations are done asynchronously, such as calculating shipping and taxes. There might be times when a draft order is created but these calculations haven't completed. In these cases, you need to poll the draft order until the calculations are finished. When a draft order requires polling, a `202 accepted` response code is returned along with `location` and `retry-after` response headers. The `location` header refers to the URL to be polled, and `retry-after` denotes the interval (in seconds) at which polling requests should be sent. When the draft order is ready, a `200 OK` response code will be returned.

### About custom shipping lines

You can use the DraftOrder resource to send orders with custom shipping lines. A custom shipping line includes a `title` and `price` with `handle` set to `Nil`. A shipping line with a carrier provided shipping rate (currently set via the Shopify admin) includes the shipping rate handle.

### Applying discounts

A draft order and its line items can have one discount each. Calculations for discounts are based on the setting of the `value_type` property, which can be set to either `fixed_amount` or `percentage`. For example, you can apply a fixed amount discount to a draft order to reduce the price by the specified `value` property. When you use a percentage discount, the discount `amount` property is the price multiplied by the `value` property. For line item discounts, the `value` property is applied per individual unit of the item, based on the line item's quantity.

**Calculating line item discount amounts**

For `fixed_amount` discounts, the total `amount` corresponds to the line item quantity times the value of the discount. For percentage discounts, the total `amount` corresponds to the following:

`amount = floor(price * quantity * value) / 100`, where `floor()` is the usual round down function.

For non-fractional currencies, this formula needs to use `round()` instead of `floor()`, and the division by 100 takes place inside the rounding, resulting in a non-fractional value. Otherwise, an error is returned.

`amount = round(price * quantity * value / 100)`

**Line item examples**

*Fixed amount discount*

For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with $5 dollars off, discount amount corresponds to $10 ($5 \* 2):

`applied_discount: { "value_type": "fixed_amount", "value": 5, "amount": 10 }`

*Percentage discount*

For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with 15% off, discount amount corresponds to $5.99 (floor ($19.99 \* 2 \* 15) / 100):

`applied_discount: { "value_type": "percentage", "value": 15, "amount": 5.99 }`

### Loading and removing customers

You can load a customer to a draft order by sending the `customer_id` as part of the draft order resource. We recommend removing a customer from a draft order by making a POST request with the `Customer` resource set to `null`, without specifying an email, shipping address, or billing address. A customer can also be removed by setting `customer`, `email`, `shipping_address`, and `billing_address` to `null`.

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

customer\_id

Used to load the customer. When a customer is loaded, the customer’s email address is also associated.

***

use\_customer\_default\_address

boolean

default false

An optional boolean that you can send as part of a draft order resource to load customer shipping information. Valid values: true or false.

## putModify an existing Draft​Order

[draftOrderUpdate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderUpdate?example=modify-an-existing-draftorder)

Updates a draft order.

All non read-only properties of the [DraftOrder Resource](#resource-object) can be edited.

Caution

If a checkout has been started for a draft order, any update to the draft will unlink the checkout. Checkouts are created but not immediately completed when opening the merchant credit card modal in the admin, and when a buyer opens the invoice URL. This is usually fine, but there is an edge case where a checkout is in progress and the draft is updated before the checkout completes. This will not interfere with the checkout and order creation, but if the link from draft to checkout is broken the draft will remain open even after the order is created.

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

draft\_order\_id

string

required

***

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Event

Events are generated by some Shopify resources when certain actions are completed, such as the creation of an article, the fulfillment of an order, or the addition of a product. By requesting events, your app can know when certain actions have occurred in the shop.

Note

The events returned by the Event resource should not be considered to be realtime. Events might not be created until a few seconds after the action occurs. In rare cases it can take up to a few minutes for some events to appear.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Fulfillment

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

You can use the `Fulfillment` resource to view fulfillments for an order or a [fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder). A fulfillment order represents a group of one or more items in an order that will be fulfilled from the same location. A fulfillment represents work that is completed as part of a fulfillment order and can include one or more items. You can use the `Fulfillment` resource to manage fulfillments for fulfillment orders.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/fulfillment_relationships.png)

This resource is typically used in apps that perform shipping-related actions, such as making tracking and delivery updates, or creating additional shipments as required for an order or fulfillment order.

Each fulfillment supports a single tracking number. If you need to use multiple tracking numbers, then you should create separate fulfillments.

[Learn about using fulfillment order-based workflows](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment).

It is highly recommended that you send the tracking company and the tracking URL.

  Note

  With the REST API, you can set only one tracking number and one tracking URL per fulfillment. If you send multiple shipments with one fulfillment, you may want to specify tracking numbers and tracking URLs for all of them. You can do it with the equivalent GraphQL [fulfillmentCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate) and [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate) mutations.

* **url**: (string) The URL to track the fulfillment.

  The tracking URL is displayed in the merchant's admin in the order page. The tracking URL is displayed in the shipping confirmation email, which can optionally be sent to the customer. When accounts are enabled, it is also displayed in the customer's order history.

  The URL must be an [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) and [RFC 3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987)-compliant URI string. For example, `https://www.myshipping.com/track/?tracknumbers=TRACKING_NUMBER` is a valid URL. It includes a scheme (`https`) and a host (`myshipping.com`). If you do not provide a scheme (`http` or `https`), then `http` will be substituted.

***

### Examples

Create a fulfillment with a tracking number of a Shopify unsupported tracking carrier, and therefore with a tracking url provided.

Create a fulfillment with a tracking number provided. Tracking url and tracking company name will be determined automatically as the tracking number format unambiguously maps to a supported company (UPS).

Create a fulfillment for all fulfillment order line items if `fulfillment_order_line_items` is left blank

Create a fulfillment for the fulfillment order line items specified

Create a fulfillment without tracking info. Tracking numbers can be set later with the `/admin/api/API_VERSION/fulfillments/FULFILLMENT_ID/update_tracking.json` endpoint.

  * **United States**: GLS, Alliance Air Freight, Pilot Freight, LSO, Old Dominion, R+L Carriers, Southwest Air Cargo
  * **South Africa**: Fastway, Skynet

* **number**: (string) The tracking number for the fulfillment.

  The tracking number will be clickable in the interface if one of the following applies (the highest in the list has the highest priority):

  * Tracking URL provided in the `url` field.
  * [Shopify-known tracking company name](#supported-tracking-companies) specified in the `company` field. Shopify will build the tracking url automatically based on the tracking number specified.
  * The tracking number has a Shopify-known format. Shopify will guess the tracking provider and build the tracking url based on the tracking number format. Not all tracking carriers are supported, and multiple tracking carriers may use similarly formatted tracking numbers. This can result in an invalid tracking URL. It is highly recommended that you send the tracking company and the tracking URL.

  Note

  With the REST API, you can set only one tracking number and one tracking URL per fulfillment. If you send multiple shipments with one fulfillment, you may want to specify tracking numbers and tracking URLs for all of them. You can do it with the equivalent GraphQL [fulfillmentCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate) and [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate) mutations.

* **url**: (string) The URL to track the fulfillment.

  The tracking URL is displayed in the merchant's admin in the order page. The tracking URL is displayed in the shipping confirmation email, which can optionally be sent to the customer. When accounts are enabled, it is also displayed in the customer's order history.

  The URL must be an [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) and [RFC 3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987)-compliant URI string. For example, `https://www.myshipping.com/track/?tracknumbers=TRACKING_NUMBER` is a valid URL. It includes a scheme (`https`) and a host (`myshipping.com`). If you do not provide a scheme (`http` or `https`), then `http` will be substituted.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Fulfillment​Event

Requires `orders` access scope.

The FulfillmentEvent resource represents tracking events that belong to a [fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillment) of one or more items in an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/orders/order). Fulfillment events are displayed on the [order status page](https://help.shopify.com/manual/orders/status-tracking) to update customers on the status of their shipment.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Fulfillment​Order

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

The FulfillmentOrder resource represents either an item or a group of items in an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/orders/order) that are to be fulfilled from the same location. There can be more than one fulfillment order for an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/orders/order) at a given location.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/fulfillment_order_relationships.png)

Fulfillment orders represent the work which is intended to be done in relation to an order. When the fulfillment of some or all line items has started, a [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillment) is created by a merchant or third party to represent the ongoing or completed work of fulfillment. [See below for more details on creating fulfillments](#fulfillment-order-creation).

Note

Shopify creates fulfillment orders automatically when an order is created. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.

[See below for more details on the lifecycle of a fulfillment order](#fulfillment-order-lifecycle).

## Retrieving fulfillment orders

## All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the [Get fulfillment orders by order ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder#get-orders-order-id-fulfillment-orders) endpoint. [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes) govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients. An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the [AssignedFulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/assignedfulfillmentorder) resource. The `assignment_status` parameter in the [Retrieve a list of assigned fulfillment orders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/assignedfulfillmentorder#get-assigned-fulfillment-orders?assignment-status=cancellation-requested\&location-ids\[]=24826418) query controls whether all assigned fulfillment orders should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a [fulfilment request](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentrequest) and it has yet to be responded to. The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access the assigned fulfillment orders.A specific fulfillment order can be retrieved with the [Get fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder#get-orders-order-id-fulfillment-orders) endpoint.

## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order

### Fulfillment Order Creation

After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items. Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.

Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.

### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location

Fulfillment orders are completed by creating [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillment). Fulfillments represents the work done.

For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset has been provisioned. For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once the gift card has been activated - before the email being shipped.

On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order, a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.

[Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).

### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service

For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service, a merchant or an Order Management App can [send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentrequest#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-fulfillment-request) to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items. A fulfillment service has the option to [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentrequest#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-fulfillment-request-accept) or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentrequest#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-fulfillment-request-accept) this fulfillment request.

Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant or order management app and instead a [cancellation request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/cancellationrequest) must be submitted to the fulfillment service.

Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request, then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the [Create a fulfillment for one or many fulfillment orders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillment#post-fulfillments) endpoint. They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then [update tracking information for fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillment#post-fulfillments-fulfillment-id-update-tracking).

[Learn about managing fulfillment orders as a fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).

## API access scopes

Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:

* The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
* The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scopes are intended for fulfillment services. These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed by fulfillment services.
* The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.

### Fulfillment service app access scopes

Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders` or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop). The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.

### Order management app access scopes

**Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders on behalf of a merchant.

If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service, then the app should request all access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.

## Notifications about fulfillment orders

Fulfillment services are required to [register](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.

Both merchants and apps can [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks) to [fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook#event-topics-fulfillment-orders-cancellation-request-accepted) to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.

## postMarks a fulfillment order as incomplete

[fulfillmentOrderClose](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderClose?example=marks-a-fulfillment-order-as-incomplete)

Requires `assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope.

Marks an in-progress fulfillment order as incomplete, indicating the fulfillment service is unable to ship any remaining items, and closes the fulfillment request.\
\
This mutation can only be called for fulfillment orders that meet the following criteria:

* Assigned to a fulfillment service location,
* The fulfillment request has been accepted,
* The fulfillment order status is `IN_PROGRESS`.

This mutation can only be called by the fulfillment service app that accepted the fulfillment request. Calling this mutation returns the control of the fulfillment order to the merchant, allowing them to move the fulfillment order line items to another location and fulfill from there, remove and refund the line items, or to request fulfillment from the same fulfillment service again.\
\
Closing a fulfillment order is explained in [the fulfillment service guide](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#step-7-optional-close-a-fulfillment-order).

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

fulfillment\_order\_id

string

required

***

message

An optional reason for marking the fulfillment order as incomplete.

## postMoves a fulfillment order to a new location

[fulfillmentOrderMove](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderMove?example=moves-a-fulfillment-order-to-a-new-location)

Requires ANY of the following access scopes: `merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders`, `third_party_fulfillment_orders`.

Changes the location which is assigned to fulfill a number of unfulfilled fulfillment order line items.\
Moving a fulfillment order will fail in the following circumstances:

* The fulfillment order is closed.
* The destination location has never stocked the requested inventory item.
* The API client doesn't have the correct permissions.

Line items which have already been fulfilled can't be re-assigned and will always remain assigned to the original location.

You can't change the assigned location while a fulfillment order has a `request_status` of `submitted`, `accepted`, `cancellation_requested`, or `cancellation_rejected`. These request statuses mean that a fulfillment order is awaiting action by a fulfillment service and can't be re-assigned without first having the fulfillment service accept a cancellation request. This behavior is intended to prevent items from being fulfilled by multiple locations or fulfillment services.

#### How re-assigning line items affects fulfillment orders

If the original fulfillment order doesn't have any line items which are fully or partially fulfilled, the original fulfillment order will be moved to the new location. However if this isn't the case, the moved fulfillment order will differ from the original one.

#### Response

* `original_fulfillment_order` - The final state of the original fulfillment order.\
  As a result of the move operation, the original fulfillment order might be moved to the new location or remain in the original location. The original fulfillment order might have the same status or be closed.
* `moved_fulfillment_order` - The fulfillment order which now contains the moved line items and is assigned to the destination location.\
  **First scenario:** All line items belonging to the original fulfillment order are re-assigned.\
  In this case, this will be the original fulfillment order.\
  **Second scenario:** A subset of the line items belonging to the original fulfillment order are re-assigned.\
  If the new location is already assigned to fulfill line items on the order, then this will be an existing active fulfillment order. Otherwise, this will be a new fulfillment order with the moved line items assigned.
* `remaining_fulfillment_order` - this field is deprecated.

## postReleases all holds on a fulfillment order

[fulfillmentOrderReleaseHold](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderReleaseHold)

Releases the fulfillment order from all fulfillment holds and changes its status from `ON_HOLD`.\
**NOTE:** It is highly recommended that apps use the [fulfillmentOrderReleaseHold GraphQL mutation](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderReleaseHold) to release specific holds by providing their IDs. Releasing all holds on a fulfillment order will result in the fulfillment order being released prematurely and items being incorrectly fulfilled.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Fulfillment​Request

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

The `FulfillmentRequest` resource represents a fulfillment request made by the merchant or an order management app to a [fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillmentservice) for a [fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillmentorder). A fulfillment service can accept or reject the fulfillment request.

## Terminating a fulfillment request

A fulfillment service can stop fulfilling an accepted fulfillment request if they choose [closing the fulfillment order as incomplete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-close). The fulfillment order can be partially fulfilled when a fulfillment service chooses to stop the fulfillment.

The merchant or an order management app can notify the fulfillment service to cancel an accepted fulfillment request by sending a [cancellation request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/cancellationrequest#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-cancellation-request). The fulfillment service can accept or reject the cancellation request. The fulfillment order can be partially fulfilled at this time.

The merchant or an order management app can also [cancel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-cancel) a fulfillment order. Calling the `cancel` endpoint results in the fulfilment order being cancelled within Shopify. This change will not be communicated to the fulfilment service. If the intention is for a fulfilment service to halt fulfilment activity, a [cancellation request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/cancellationrequest#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-cancellation-request) should be sent to the fulfilment service instead, as described above.

## Retrieving fulfillment request details

The `FulfillmentOrder` resource and the `merchant_requests` field can be used to retrieve the merchant requests which have been made. The overall status of these requests is also available using the `request_status` field of the fulfillment order.

To learn more about the fulfillment request process in the fulfillment workflow, refer to [Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments) guide.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Fulfillment​Service

Requires `fulfillments` access scope.

A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new `FulfillmentService` on a store, Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the fulfillment service. To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to [Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps) guide.

Using the `FulfillmentService` resource, you can register, edit, and delete a new fulfillment service.

## Hosted endpoints

Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that Shopify can query on certain conditions. These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callback_url` parameter in the request that creates the fulfillment service.

* Shopify sends POST requests to the `callback_url/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests.\
  [As of the 2022-07 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/legacy-fulfillment-api-deprecation), it's mandatory for a fulfillment service to follow a fulfillment order based workflow by hosting the `callback_url/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint, and acting on fulfillment requests and cancellations.\
  For more information, refer to [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
* Shopify sends GET requests to the `callback_url/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders if `tracking_support` is set to `true`.\
  For more information, refer to [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#step-9-optional-enable-tracking-support).\
  Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with a [corresponding API](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillment#post-fulfillments-fulfillment-id-update-tracking), rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
* Shopify sends GET requests to the `callback_url/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve on hand inventory levels for the fulfillment service location if `inventory_management` is set to `true`.\
  For more information, refer to [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#step-10-optional-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify).

To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callback_url`-prefixed endpoints in your development store.

## Resources and webhooks

There are a variety of REST resources and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work. To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the [FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder), [FulfillmentRequest](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentrequest), and [CancellationRequest](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/cancellationrequest), [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillment) and [Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/order) resources. To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side, besides awaiting calls to `callback_url`-prefixed endpoints, fulfillment services can subscribe to the [fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks) and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook) webhooks.

[fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate?example=modify-an-existing-fulfillmentservice)

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

fulfillment\_service\_id

string

required

***

callback\_url

The callback URL that the fulfillment service has registered for requests. The following considerations apply:

Show callback\_url properties

* Shopify queries the `callback_url/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders, if `tracking_support` is set to `true`.
* Shopify queries the `callback_url/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels, if `inventory_management` is set to `true`.
* Shopify uses the `callback_url/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint to send [fulfillment and cancellation requests](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations)

***

fulfillment\_orders\_opt\_in

boolean

Whether the fulfillment service uses the [fulfillment order based workflow](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments) for managing fulfillments.\
As the migration is now finished, the `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` property is [deprecated.](https://shopify.dev/changelog/deprecation-of-the-fulfillmentservice-fulfillmentordersoptin-field)

***

inventory\_management

boolean

Whether the fulfillment service tracks product inventory and provides updates to Shopify. Valid values: `true` and `false`.

***

name

string

The name of the fulfillment service as seen by merchants.

***

permits\_sku\_sharing

boolean

Whether the fulfillment service can stock inventory alongside other locations. In the next version, all new fulfillment services will support SKU sharing by default. As of version `2026-04`, this field will be removed.

***

requires\_shipping\_method

boolean

Whether the fulfillment service requires products to be physically shipped. Valid values: `true` and `false`.

***

tracking\_support

boolean

Whether the fulfillment service provides tracking numbers for packages. Valid values: `true` and `false`.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Gift Card

Requires `gift_cards` access scope.

Note

You need to contact Shopify Support to request the `write_gift_cards` and `read_gift_cards` [access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).

A gift card is an alternative payment method. Each gift card has a unique code that is entered during checkout. Its balance can be redeemed over multiple checkouts. Optionally, a gift card can assigned to a specific customer. Gift card codes cannot be retrieved after they're created—only the last four characters can be retrieved.

You can use the GiftCard resource to create, retrieve, and update gift cards for a store. After a gift card is created, only the expiry date, note, and template suffix can be updated.

Note

You can't delete gift cards, but you can disable them. You can't enable gift cards that were previously disabled.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Inventory​Item

Requires `inventory` access scope.

An inventory item represents a physical good. It holds essential information about the physical good, including its SKU and whether its inventory is tracked.

There is a 1:1 relationship between a product variant and an inventory item. Each product variant includes the ID of its related inventory item. You can use the inventory item ID to query the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource to retrieve the location and quantity for an inventory item.

Use the InventoryItem resource together with the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) and [Location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) resources to manage a store's inventory across multiple locations.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Inventory​Level

Requires `inventory` access scope.

An inventory level represents the quantities of an inventory item for a location.

Each inventory level belongs to one inventory item and has one location. For every location where an inventory item can be stocked, there's an inventory level that represents the inventory item's quantities relating to that location.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/inventory.png)

Before you begin updating inventory, it's helpful to understand the relationships between the inventory resources:

* **[Product Variant](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/product-variant)**: Contains merchandising information, such as price, description, and images. Think of this as the product information that you might want a customer to see.

  All product variants have a 1:1 relationship with their associated inventory item. Each product variant has one inventory item, and that inventory item belongs only to that product variant.

* **[InventoryItem](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventoryitem)**: Contains information about the physical product, such as its SKU. Think of this as the back-end information used for managing inventory, shipping, and fulfillments.

  Inventory items are associated with one or many inventory levels. An inventory item will have an inventory level for each location where the item is stocked.

* **[InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel)**: Represents the actual quantity of an item that is available.

  Inventory levels connect one inventory item to one location. Each inventory level holds the available quantity for its inventory item at the associated location.

* **[Location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location)**: Represents a geographical location where a merchant does business, such as a retail store or warehouse.

  Locations can have many inventory levels. Each location has one inventory level for each inventory item that the location stocks.

## How an order affects inventory

When a product variant that Shopify tracks is included in an order, Shopify decrements the inventory for that variant. Shopify doesn't know which location the item will be fulfilled from, so Shopify decrements the inventory level at the location that has the lowest ID.

Note

Orders placed through Shopify POS are associated with the location where the sale was made. For those orders, inventory is decremented at that location.

When an order is fulfilled, the fulfillment includes the ID of the location where the fulfillment is taking place. Shopify checks whether the fulfillment location matches the original location where stock was decremented, and then adjusts the inventory if necessary:

* If the fulfillment location matches the original location, then no action is needed.
* If the fulfillment location doesn't match the original location, then Shopify decrements the inventory level at the fulfillment location and increments the inventory level at the original location.

### Example: Inventory adjustments for a simple order

An online store uses two warehouses to stock product inventory: one in Los Angeles (ID: `6884556842`), and one in New York (ID: `13968834616`). One of the store's products is a hat that's stocked at both locations with the following inventory levels:

* Los Angeles: 8
* New York: 6

A customer places an order for a hat. The Los Angeles location has the lowest ID, so Shopify decrements the item's inventory level at that location:

* Los Angeles: 7
* New York: 6

The order is actually fulfilled from the New York location. When the fulfillment is created, it includes the ID for the New York location. Shopify compares the fulfillment location ID to the original location and finds that they're different. Shopify then increments the inventory level at the Los Angeles location, and decrements the inventory level at the New York location:

* Los Angeles: 8
* New York: 5

## Inventory levels and fulfillment service locations

A fulfillment service [location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) has a 1:1 relationship with a third-party fulfillment service. When an app [creates a new fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) on a store, Shopify automatically creates a location that's associated with that fulfillment service. The FulfillmentService resource has a `location_id` property, which identifies the associated location.

An inventory item connected to a fulfillment service location can't be connected to any other locations at the same time:

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/location-types.png)

### Connecting an inventory item to a fulfillment service location

When you work with items that have been or will be connected a fulfillment location, you should include `"relocate_if_necessary": true` in the body of the request. There are two situations where you might do this:

* connecting an inventory item to a fulfillment service location and disconnecting it from all standard locations
* connecting an inventory item to one or more standard locations and disconnecting it from a fulfillment service location

If `relocate_if_necessary` is `true`, then all inventory for the item is relocated to the new location and disconnected from any other locations. If a fulfillment service location is involved but `relocate_if_necessary` is `false`, then the connection will fail. If no fulfillment service is involved, then the property is ignored and no inventory is relocated.

### Setting the inventory level at a fulfillment service location

When you set inventory for a location, the inventory item is connected to the location if they are not already connected. If the item has been or will be connected to a fulfillment service location, then you should include `"disconnect_if_necessary": true` in the body of the request. There are two situations where you might do this:

* setting inventory for an inventory item at a fulfillment service location when the item is already connected to one or more standard locations
* setting inventory for an inventory item at a standard location when the item is already connected to a fulfillment service location

The inventory at the new location is set to the value of the `available` property. The inventory for other locations is set to 0 and the locations are disconnected from the inventory item.

If `disconnect_if_necessary` is set to `false` when you set inventory at a location and a fulfillment service location is involved, then the action will fail. If no fulfillment service location is involved, then this property is ignored.

  Retrieve the locations that a merchant has set up from their Shopify admin.
  Each location refers to the address of a business's headquarters, retail
  stores, pop-up stores, and warehouses. The store's locations are used to track
  sales and to configure the tax rates applied at checkout.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Location

A location represents a geographical location where your stores, pop-up stores, headquarters, and warehouses exist. You can use the Location resource to track sales, manage inventory, and configure the tax rates to apply at checkout. For a better understanding of the relationship between locations, inventory levels and inventory items, refer to the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource reference documentation

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql).

# Marketing​Event

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Marketing events represent actions taken by your app, on behalf of the merchant, to market products, collections, discounts, pages, blog posts, and other features. These actions target multiple potential customers, rather than specific individuals. For example, you should model your marketing event at the email campaign level, rather than on a per-email basis.

Merchants get value from marketing events because they help them understand sales and traffic attribution. Implementing marketing events for your app is beneficial because it enables Shopify to surface your app in the Shopify admin in ways that are helpful to merchants. Examples of marketing events include an ad campaign that drives multiple potential customers to a product page, or an email marketing campaign advertising a discount code.

**[Marketing events](#post-marketing-events)** can be created for email campaigns, affiliate links, advertisements, and other common marketing tactics. Marketing events include the `event_type` and `marketing_channel` properties that help Shopify to rank your app and surface it in the Shopify admin in ways that are useful to merchants. Traffic and order attribution for your app is handled by providing UTM parameters with your marketing events. The same UTM parameters are also used in the links provided in the marketing event.

**[Engagements](#post-marketing-events-marketing-event-id-engagements)** can also be added to marketing events to give merchants more insight into how potential customers interact with your marketing events. For example, engagements for ad campaigns can include clicks, shares, and comments. Creating engagements is optional, and not all marketing events include engagements.

When creating the marketing event, the body of the request includes the UTM parameters that must be included in the links provided in the marketing event. Each marketing event also includes the `event_type` and `marketing_channel` properties that help Shopify to rank your app and surface it within Shopify admin.



After a marketing event is created in Shopify, you can start to drive traffic to Shopify. Make sure that the links for the marketing event contain the same UTM parameters that were defined in the marketing event. For example, marketing activities for the Christmas 2022 ad campaign would use the following URL convention:



`https://storename.com/product?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Christmas2022-12142018`

## postCreates marketing engagements on a marketing event

[marketingEngagementCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/marketingEngagementCreate?example=creates-marketing-engagements-on-a-marketing-event)

Engagements on marketing events represent customer activity taken on the marketing event before customers reach the shop’s website. Not all types of marketing events will necessarily have engagement, and most types of marketing events will only use a subset of the possible engagement types.



Engagements are aggregated on a daily basis. However, the data can be sent more often than once a day if the information is available. If you create an engagement with the same value for `occurred_on` as an existing engagement, then the new engagement will overwrite the previous one.

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

marketing\_event\_id

string

required

***

occurred\_on

required

The date that these engagements occurred on, in the format “YYYY-MM-DD”.

***

ad\_spend

The total ad spend for the day, if the marketing event is a paid ad with a daily spend.

***

clicks\_count

The total number of clicks on the marketing event for the day.

***

comments\_count

The total number of comments for the day.

***

favorites\_count

The total number of favorites for the day.

***

impressions\_count

The total number of impressions for the day. An impression occurs when the marketing event is served to a customer, either as a email or through a marketing channel.

***

is\_cumulative

Whether the engagements are reported as lifetime values rather than daily totals.

***

shares\_count

The total number of shares for the day.

***

views\_count

The total number of views for the day. A view occurs when a customer reads the marketing event that was served to them, for example, if the customer opens the email or spends time looking at a Facebook post.

***

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Metafield

Metafields are a flexible way to attach additional information to a Shopify resource (e.g. Product, Collection, etc.). Some examples of data stored using metafields include specifications, size charts, downloadable documents, release dates, images, or part numbers. Metafields are identified by an owner resource, a namespace, and a key and they store a value along with type information for that context.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Mobile​Platform​Application

Requires `mobile_platform_applications` access scope.

Note

Please contact Shopify Support to enable this scope for your app

You can use the `MobilePlatformApplication` resource to enable [shared web credentials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/shared_web_credentials) for Shopify iOS apps, as well as to create [iOS universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) or [Android app link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/) verification endpoints for merchant Shopify iOS or Android apps. Shared web credentials let iOS users access a native app after logging into the respective website in Safari without re-entering their username and password. If a user changes their credentials in the app, then those changes are reflected in Safari. You must use a custom domain to integrate shared web credentials with Shopify. With each platform's link system, users can tap a link to a shop's website and get seamlessly redirected to a merchant's installed app without going through a browser or manually selecting an app.

For full configuration instructions on iOS shared web credentials, see the [associated domains setup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/setting_up_an_app_s_associated_domains) technical documentation.

For full configuration instructions on iOS universal links or Android App Links, see the respective [iOS universal link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content) or [Android app link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations) technical documentation.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Order Risk

Requires `orders` access scope.

The Order Risk resource allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete order risks. Order risks represent the results of fraud checks that have been completed for an order.

#### Usage notes

Caution

As of version 2024-04 this resource is deprecated. Risk Assessments can be queried via the [Order Risk Assessment API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2024-04/objects/OrderRiskAssessment).

* This resource is deprecated in version 2024-04. Please refer to the GraphQL api for [Order#field-order-risk](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2024-04/objects/Order#field-order-risk)
* When determining an order's risk level, Shopify takes into account only those order risks that have the display property set to `true`. Orders with a display set to `false` will not be returned through the Order Risk resource. It's not advised to create order risks with a display set to `false`. This property might be removed in future API versions.
* Risk assessments will favor the most severe risk recommendation for an order. Keep this in mind when creating new order risks.

## The Order Risk resource

### Properties

***

cause\_cancel

->[recommendation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderRiskSummary#field-OrderRiskSummary.fields.recommendation)

Whether this order risk is severe enough to force the cancellation of the order. If `true`, then this order risk is included in the **Order canceled** message that's shown on the details page of the canceled order.

**Note:** Setting this property to `true` does not cancel the order. Use this property only if your app automatically cancels the order using the [Order](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/orders/order/#cancel-{{%20current_version%20}}) resource. If your app doesn't automatically cancel orders based on order risks, then leave this property set to `false`.

***

checkout\_id

deprecated

The ID of the checkout that the order risk belongs to.

***

display

deprecated

Whether the order risk is displayed on the order details page in the Shopify admin. If `false`, then this order risk is ignored when Shopify determines your app's overall risk level for the order.

It's not advised to create order risks with a display set to `false`.

Note

This property can't be changed after an order risk is created.

This property might be removed in future API versions.

***

id

deprecated

A unique numeric identifier for the order risk.

***

merchant\_message

deprecated

The message that's displayed to the merchant to indicate the results of the fraud check. The message is displayed only if `display` is set to`true`.

***

message

->[description](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/RiskFact#field-RiskFact.fields.description)

The message that's displayed to the merchant to indicate the results of the fraud check. The message is displayed only if `display` is set to`true`.

***

order\_id

->[id](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#field-Order.fields.id)

The ID of the order that the order risk belongs to.

***

recommendation

->[recommendation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderRiskSummary#field-OrderRiskSummary.fields.recommendation)

The recommended action given to the merchant. Valid values:

Show recommendation properties

* **cancel**: There is a high level of risk that this order is fraudulent. The merchant should cancel the order.
* **investigate**: There is a medium level of risk that this order is fraudulent. The merchant should investigate the order.
* **accept**: There is a low level of risk that this order is fraudulent. The order risk found no indication of fraud.

***

score

string

->[riskLevel](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderRiskAssessment#field-OrderRiskAssessment.fields.riskLevel)

**For internal use only**. A number between 0 and 1 that's assigned to the order. The closer the score is to 1, the more likely it is that the order is fraudulent.

Note

There is no guarantee of stability in risk scores. Scores are not probabilities. The relationship between scores and the probability of fraud can vary over time and between risk providers.

***

source

->[provider](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderRiskAssessment#field-OrderRiskAssessment.fields.provider)

The source of the order risk.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Order

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

An order is a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a shop. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete orders using the Order resource.

#### Usage notes

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/order.png)

* When you create an order through the API, no payment information is collected, and no transaction is performed.
* After an order is created, you can change only a few of its attributes using the API. You can't change the items or the quantities in an order using the REST API, but you can change them using the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/order-editing).
* You can add [metafields](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/metafield) to the Order resource.
* You can allow merchants to create orders manually by using the [DraftOrder resource](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/draftorder).

Caution

You can't use the Order resource to create a new checkout for an individual store. To create a checkout, you need to use the [Checkout API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/checkout) or an SDK powered by the [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront), such as the [JavaScript Buy SDK](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/additional-sdks/js-buy), [iOS Buy SDK](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/mobile-kit/buy-sdk-ios), or [Android Buy SDK](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/mobile-kit/buy-sdk-android).

Caution

Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the Order resource by default. If you want to access older orders, then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted access, then you can add the `read_all_orders` scope to your app along with `read_orders` or `write_orders`.

Only use this data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

## postCreate an order

[customerCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/customerCreate)

[orderCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreate)

Requires `orders` access scope.

Creates an order.

By default, product inventory is not claimed when creating an order.

There are additional optional parameters that can be specified in the body of the request when creating an order:

  * **bypass**: Do not claim inventory.
  * **decrement\_ignoring\_policy**: Ignore the product's inventory policy and claim inventory.
  * **decrement\_obeying\_policy**: Follow the product's inventory policy and claim inventory, if possible.

* **send\_receipt**: Whether to send an order confirmation to the customer. (default: `false`)

Note

* **send\_fulfillment\_receipt**: Whether to send a shipping confirmation to the customer. (default: `false`)

Note

If you are including **shipping\_address** or **billing\_address**, make sure to pass both **first\_name** and **last\_name**. Otherwise both these addresses will be ignored.

array

A list of line item objects, each containing information about an item in the order. Each object has the following properties:

Show line\_items properties

* **attributed\_staffs**: The staff members attributed to the line item.

  * `id`: The id of the staff member.
  * `quantity`: The quantity of the line item attributed to the staff member.

* **fulfillable\_quantity**: The amount available to fulfill, calculated as follows:
  ```
  quantity - max(refunded_quantity, fulfilled_quantity) - pending_fulfilled_quantity - open_fulfilled_quantity
  ```

* **fulfillment\_service**: The handle of a fulfillment service that stocks the product variant belonging to a line item.

  This is the handle of a third-party fulfillment service in the following scenarios:

  **Scenario 1**

  1. The product variant is stocked by a single fulfillment service.
  2. The [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) is a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.

  **Scenario 2**

  1. Multiple fulfillment services stock the product variant.
  2. The last time that the line item was unfulfilled, it was awaiting fulfillment by a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.

  If none of the above conditions are met, then this is `manual`.

  The [relationship between a product variant and a fulfillment service was changed in the `2022-07` API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/fulfillment-service-sku-sharing). A [ProductVariant](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/product-variant) can be stocked by multiple fulfillment services. As a result, we recommend that you use the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource if you need to determine where a product variant is stocked.

  If you previously set this field, then we recommend that you instead [connect inventory items to locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel#post-inventory-levels-connect). Each [Location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) is associated with a single [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice). The value of this field after setting it will be as described above.

  If you need to determine whether a product is a gift card, then you should continue to use this field until an alternative is available.

  Altering the locations which stock a product variant won't change the value of this field for existing orders.

  Learn more about [managing inventory quantities and states](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/inventory-management-apps/quantities-states).

* **fulfillment\_status**: How far along an order is in terms line items fulfilled. Valid values: `null`, `fulfilled`, `partial`, and `not_eligible`.

  This is the handle of a third-party fulfillment service in the following scenarios:

  **Scenario 1**

  1. The product variant is stocked by a single fulfillment service.
  2. The [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) is a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.

  **Scenario 2**

  1. Multiple fulfillment services stock the product variant.
  2. The last time that the line item was unfulfilled, it was awaiting fulfillment by a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.

  If none of the above conditions are met, then this is `manual`.

  The [relationship between a product variant and a fulfillment service was changed in the `2022-07` API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/fulfillment-service-sku-sharing). A [ProductVariant](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/product-variant) can be stocked by multiple fulfillment services. As a result, we recommend that you use the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource if you need to determine where a product variant is stocked.

  If you previously set this field, then we recommend that you instead [connect inventory items to locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel#post-inventory-levels-connect).

The value of this field after setting it will be as described above.

  If you need to determine whether a product is a gift card, then you should continue to use this field until an alternative is available.

  Altering the locations which stock a product variant won't change the value of this field for existing orders.

As a result, we recommend that you use the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource if you need to determine where a product variant is stocked.

  If you previously set this field, then we recommend that you instead [connect inventory items to locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel#post-inventory-levels-connect). Each [Location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) is associated with a single [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice). The value of this field after setting it will be as described above.

  If you need to determine whether a product is a gift card, then you should continue to use this field until an alternative is available.

  Altering the locations which stock a product variant won't change the value of this field for existing orders.

  Altering the locations which stock a product variant won't change the value of this field for existing orders.

array

->[taxLines](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/OrderCreateOrderInput#fields-taxLines)

An array of tax line objects, each of which details a tax applicable to the order. Each object has the following properties:

Show tax\_lines properties

* **price**: The amount added to the order for this tax in the shop currency after discounts are applied.
* **rate**: The rate of tax to be applied.
* **title**: The name of the tax.
* **channel\_liable**: Whether the channel that submitted the tax line is liable for remitting. A value of `null` indicates unknown liability for the tax line.

When creating an order through the API, tax lines can be specified on the order or the line items but not both. Tax lines specified on the order are split across the *taxable* line items in the created order.

array

A list of line item objects, each containing information about an item in the order. Each object has the following properties:

Show line\_items properties

* **attributed\_staffs**: The staff members attributed to the line item.

  * `id`: The id of the staff member.
  * `quantity`: The quantity of the line item attributed to the staff member.

* **fulfillable\_quantity**: The amount available to fulfill, calculated as follows:
  ```
  quantity - max(refunded_quantity, fulfilled_quantity) - pending_fulfilled_quantity - open_fulfilled_quantity
  ```

* **fulfillment\_service**: The handle of a fulfillment service that stocks the product variant belonging to a line item.

  This is the handle of a third-party fulfillment service in the following scenarios:

  **Scenario 1**

  1. The product variant is stocked by a single fulfillment service.
  2. The [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) is a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.

  **Scenario 2**

  1. Multiple fulfillment services stock the product variant.
  2. The last time that the line item was unfulfilled, it was awaiting fulfillment by a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.

  If none of the above conditions are met, then this is `manual`.

  The [relationship between a product variant and a fulfillment service was changed in the `2022-07` API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/fulfillment-service-sku-sharing). A [ProductVariant](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/product-variant) can be stocked by multiple fulfillment services. As a result, we recommend that you use the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource if you need to determine where a product variant is stocked.

  If you previously set this field, then we recommend that you instead [connect inventory items to locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel#post-inventory-levels-connect). Each [Location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) is associated with a single [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice). The value of this field after setting it will be as described above.

  If you need to determine whether a product is a gift card, then you should continue to use this field until an alternative is available.

  Altering the locations which stock a product variant won't change the value of this field for existing orders.

## putUpdate an order

[orderUpdate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderUpdate)

Requires ANY of the following access scopes: `orders`, `marketplace_orders`.

This operation allows for updating properties of an order including `buyer_accepts_marketing`, `email`, `phone`, `note`, `tags`, `metafields` and `shipping_address_attributes`.

It is not for editing the items of an order.

Note

After an order is created, you can change only a few of its attributes using the API. You can't change the items or the quantities in an order using the REST API, but you can change them using the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/order-editing).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Page

Requires `content` access scope.

In addition to an online storefront, Shopify stores come with a tool for creating basic HTML web pages. Store owners can create any number of pages to hold static content, such as an **About us** page, a **Contact us** page, or a page with customer testimonials.

These web pages are represented by the Page resource, and their HTML content is contained in the value of the `body_html` property. The Page resource lets you retrieve, create, update, and delete web pages for a store.

Pages are meant to be used for long-term, static content that rarely changes. For creating content on a regular basis, use the [Blog](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/online-store/blog) resource instead.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Payment

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Requires access to [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data).

Note

Sales channels require elevated permissions to interact with the Payment resource. For more information, see the *Request Payment Processing* section on the [Start building a sales channel app](https://shopify.dev/apps/channels/getting-started) page.

The Payment resource allows sales channels to build a fully native checkout experience by submitting a customer's payment details directly to Shopify.

To complete a payment using the Payment resource, first create a payment session by submitting the card details to Shopify's card vault in exchange for a session ID. The session ID can then be used to create a payment for an existing [Checkout](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/sales-channels/checkout).

The Payment resource is compatible only with direct payment gateways. For a list of all supported payment gateways, see [*Direct and external credit card payment providers*](https://help.shopify.com/manual/payments/third-party-providers/direct-and-external-providers).

\#

## Endpoints

* [post](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/payment.md#post-checkouts-token-payments)

  [/admin/api/latest/checkouts/{token}/payments.​json](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/payment.md#post-checkouts-token-payments)

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Policy

You can use the Policy resource to access the policies that a merchant has configured for their shop, such as their refund and privacy policies.

Only the shop owner can edit this information from the Shopify admin. The Policy resource lets you only retrieve information about a shop's policies.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024.

For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Product Variant

Requires `products` access scope.

Important

Listing, creating, updating, and deleting product variants is deprecated as of REST API 2024-04. For more information, refer to the [guide to the new product model](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin/migrate/new-product-model).

Important

Apps can no longer set inventory using `inventory_quantity`. For more information, refer to the [`Inventory Level`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource.

A variant can be added to a Product resource to represent one version of a product with several options. The Product resource will have a variant for every possible combination of its options. Each product can have a maximum of three options and a maximum of 100 variants.

## The Product Variant resource

### Properties

***

barcode

->[barcode](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-ProductVariant.fields.barcode)

The barcode, UPC, or ISBN number for the product.

***

compare\_at\_price

->[compareAtPrice](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-ProductVariant.fields.compareAtPrice)

The original price of the item before an adjustment or a sale.

***

created\_at

->[createdAt](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-ProductVariant.fields.createdAt)

The date and time ([ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) when the product variant was created.

***

fulfillment\_service

->[fulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location#field-Location.fields.fulfillmentService)

The handle of a fulfillment service that stocks a product variant.

This is the handle of a third-party fulfillment service if the following conditions are met:

1. The product variant is stocked by a single fulfillment service.
2. The [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice) is a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value `manual`.
3. The fulfillment service [hasn't opted into SKU sharing](https://shopify.dev/changelog/fulfillment-service-sku-sharing).

If the conditions aren't met, then this is `manual`.

The [relationship between a product variant and a fulfillment service was changed in the `2022-07` API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/fulfillment-service-sku-sharing). A [ProductVariant](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/product-variant) can be stocked by multiple fulfillment services. As a result, we recommend that you use the [InventoryLevel](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel) resource if you need to determine where a product variant is stocked.

If you previously set this field, then we recommend that you instead [connect an inventory item to a location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/inventorylevel#post-inventory-levels-connect). Each [Location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location) is associated with a single [FulfillmentService](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentservice). The value of this field after setting it will be as described above.

If you need to determine whether a product is a gift card, then you should continue to use this field until an alternative is available.

Learn more about [managing inventory quantities and states](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/inventory-management-apps/quantities-states).

***

grams

deprecated

The weight of the product variant in grams.

***

id

->[id](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-ProductVariant.fields.id)

***

image\_id

->[image](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-ProductVariant.fields.image)

The unique numeric identifier for a product's image. The image must be associated to the same product as the variant.

***

inventory\_item\_id

->[inventoryItem](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-ProductVariant.fields.inventoryItem)

The unique identifier for the inventory item, which is used in the Inventory API to query for inventory information.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Province

Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.

Important

The REST Province API is deprecated as of version 2024-07.

Please refer to the documentation for each individual endpoint and the [developer changelog](https://shopify.dev/changelog/deprecation-notice-country-and-province-endpoints-in-admin-rest-api) for more information.

The Province resource represents the sales tax that's applied to orders based the sub-regions of a country. Sub-regions might include counties, emirates, governorates, prefectures, provinces, regions, states, and territories.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/province.png)

You can use the Province resource to retrieve and update [available sub-regions](#countries-that-have-provinces-in-shopify) for only the countries that a shop owner has added to a shipping zone. Merchants add countries to a shipping zone from the **Shipping** page of their Shopify admin.

For information on accessing the tax information for an entire country, including its provinces, see the [Country](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/country) resource.

Caution

As of version 2020-10, you can no longer update custom tax values for the Province resource.

## The Province resource

### Properties

***

code

The standard abbreviation for the province.

***

country\_id

The ID for the country that the province belongs to.

***

id

The ID for the province.

***

name

The full name of the province.

***

shipping\_zone\_id

The ID for the shipping zone that the province belongs to.

***

tax

The sales tax rate to be applied to orders made by customers from this province.

***

tax\_name

The name of the tax for this province.

***

tax\_type

The tax type. Valid values: `null`, `normal`, `harmonized`, or `compounded`.

A harmonized tax is a combination of provincial and federal sales taxes.

Normal and harmonized tax rates are applied to the pre-tax value of an order, but a compounded tax rate is applied on top of other tax rates. For example, if a $100 order receives a 5% normal tax rate and a 2% compound tax rate, then the post-tax total is $107.10 (`(100 x 1.05) x 1.02 = 107.1`).

***

tax\_percentage

The province's tax in percent format.

***

Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Recurring​Application​Charge

The RecurringApplicationCharge resource facilitates a fixed-value, 30-day recurring charge. You can create an application charge by sending a request with the name the charge should appear under, the price your app is charging, and a return URL where Shopify redirects the merchant after the charge is accepted. After you've created the charge, redirect the merchant to the confirmation URL returned by Shopify. If the charge is declined, then Shopify redirects the merchant and provides a notification message that the app charge was declined.

Note

For testing purposes you can include `"test": true` when creating the charge. This prevents the credit card from being charged. Test shops and demo shops cannot be charged.

### Updating an application charge

Each shop can have only one recurring charge per app. When a new recurring application charge is activated for a shop that already has one, the existing recurring charge is canceled and replaced by the new charge. The new recurring charge is then activated.

For example, if you want to offer discounted pricing to a specific merchant, then you can create a new application charge for the shop. This will prompt the shop to accept the new charge in order to continue using the app. The new charge replaces the old billing going forward.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Redirect

Requires `content` access scope.

A redirect causes a visitor on a specific path on the shop's site to be automatically sent to a different location, called the **target**. The target can be a new path on the shop's site or a full URL. The new URL can even be on a completely different domain. Redirect paths are unique, so a shop can't have more than one redirect with the same path.

description: >-
  Create and retrieve refunds for an order. Each refund is a record of money
  being returned to the customer. Use the calculate endpoint to make sure that
  any refund that you create is accurate.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Refund

Requires ANY of the following access scopes: `orders`, `marketplace_orders`.

The Refund resource has two major components:

* Transaction records of money returned to the customer
* The line items included in the refund, along with restocking instructions

Before you create a refund, use the `calculate` endpoint to generate accurate refund transactions. Specify the line items that are being refunded, their quantity and restock instructions, and whether you're refunding shipping costs. You can then use the response of the `calculate` endpoint to create the actual refund.

When you create a refund using the response from the `calculate` endpoint, you can set additional options, such as whether to notify the customer of the refund. You can refund less than the calculated amount for either shipping or the line items by setting a custom value for the `amount` property.

If a refund includes shipping costs, or if you choose to refund line items for less than their calculated amount, then an order adjustment is created automatically to account for the discrepancy in the store's financial reports.

## postCalculates a refund

[order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/order)

Caution

For multi-currency orders, the `currency` property is required whenever the `amount` property is provided.

Calculates refund transactions based on line items and shipping. When you want to create a refund, you should first use the `calculate` endpoint to generate accurate refund transactions. Specify the line items that are being refunded, their quantity and restock instructions, and whether you intend to refund shipping costs. If the restock instructions can't be met—for example, because you try to return more items than have been fulfilled—then the endpoint returns modified restock instructions. You can then use the response in the body of the request to create the actual refund.

The response includes a `transactions` object with `"kind": "suggested_refund"`, which must to be changed to `"kind" : "refund"` for the refund to be accepted.

### Parameters

***

api\_version

string

required

***

order\_id

string

required

***

currency

The three-letter code ([ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format) for the currency used for the refund. **Note:** Required whenever the shipping `amount` property is provided.

***

refund\_line\_items

A list of line item IDs, quantities to refund, and restock instructions. Each entry has the following properties:

Show refund\_line\_items properties

* **line\_item\_id**: The ID of a line item to refund.

* **quantity**: The quantity to refund.

* **restock\_type**: How this refund line item affects inventory levels. Valid values:

  * **no\_restock**: Refunding these items won't affect inventory.
  * **cancel**: The items have not yet been fulfilled. The canceled quantity will be added back to the available count. The number of fulfillable units for this line item will decrease.
  * **return**: The items were already delivered but will be returned to the merchant. The returned quantity will be added back to the available count. The number of fulfillable units for this line item will remain unchanged.

* **location\_id**: The ID of the [location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/current/resources/location) where the items should be restocked. If `location_id` is not provided and the value of `restock_type` is `return` or `cancel`, then the endpoint returns a suitable location ID.

* **already\_stocked**: Whether the item is already stocked at the location. If this is `false`, then creating the refund will connect the item to the location and start stocking it there.

***

shipping

Specify how much shipping to refund. It has the following properties:

Show shipping properties

* **full\_refund**: Whether to refund all remaining shipping.

* **amount**: Set a specific amount to refund for shipping. Takes precedence over `full_refund`.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Resource​Feedback

Requires `resource_feedbacks` access scope.

The ResourceFeedback resource lets your app report the status of shops and their resources. For example, if your app is a marketplace channel, then you can use resource feedback to alert merchants that they need to connect their marketplace account by signing in.

Resource feedback notifications are displayed to the merchant on the home screen of their Shopify admin, and in the product details view for any products that are published to your app.

This resource should be used only in cases where you're describing steps that a merchant is required to complete. If your app offers optional or promotional set-up steps, or if it makes recommendations, then don't use resource feedback to let merchants know about them.

## Sending feedback on a shop

You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can have one of two states: `requires_action` or `success`. You need to send a `requires_action` feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.

If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send feedback with a state of `requires_action` as merchants complete prior steps. And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a `success` feedback request.

Important

Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the Shop. Unlike REST-style APIs, you don't need to make a PATCH or PUT request to update any previously sent feedback. Send a new POST request to push the latest state of a shop or its resources to Shopify.

## Formatting the resource feedback message field

If the feedback state is `requires_action`, then you can send a string message that communicates the action to be taken by the merchant.

The string must be a single message up to 100 characters long and must end with a period. You need to adhere to the message formatting rules or your requests will fail:

* `[Explanation of the problem]. [Suggested action].`



**Examples:**

* `[Your app name]` is not connected. Connect your account to use this sales channel. `[Learn more]`

* `[Your app name]` is not configured. Agree to the terms and conditions to use this app. `[Learn more]`



Both `Your app name` and `Learn more` (a button which directs merchants to your app) are automatically populated in the Shopify admin.

## Setting feedback permissions

Add the `write_resource_feedbacks` permission to your [requested scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Script​Tag

Requires `script_tags` access scope.

Theme app extensions

If your app integrates with a Shopify theme and you plan to submit it to the Shopify App Store, you must use theme app extensions instead of Script tags. Script tags can only be used with vintage themes. [Learn more](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store#what-integration-method-should-i-use).

The ScriptTag resource represents remote JavaScript code that is loaded into the pages of a shop's storefront or the order status page of checkout. This lets you add functionality to those pages without using theme templates.

Script tags are scoped to the app that created them. When an app is uninstalled from a shop, all of the script tags that it created are automatically removed along with it.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Shipping​Zone

You can use the ShippingZone resource to view shipping zones and their countries, provinces, and shipping rates. A shipping zone belongs to a delivery profile, which provides shops with the ability to create shipping rates per product variant and per location. For example, the merchant might want to use a shipping rate that applies only to fragile products. When querying the ShippingZone resource, each shipping zone is returned with its corresponding profile ID, location group ID, and countries. Its possible for the same country to exist in multiple shipping zones, if the shipping zones with overlapping countries have different delivery profiles.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Shop

The Shop resource is a collection of general business and store management settings and information about the store. The resource lets you retrieve information about the store, but it doesn't let you update any information. Only the merchant can update this information from inside the Shopify admin.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Smart​Collection

Requires `products` access scope.

A smart collection is a grouping of products defined by rules that are set by the merchant. Shopify automatically changes the contents of a smart collection based on the rules. Smart collections, like other types of collections, are used to break down the catalog of products into categories and make the shop easier to browse.

By default, a store can have up to 5000 smart collections.

The [Collect](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/collect) resource is used to connect a product to a smart collection. However, these collects can't be added or removed from the API as they're managed by the rules of the smart collection.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/smart-collection.png)

You can use the [CustomCollection](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/customcollection) resource to work with collections where each product in the collection is manually chosen by the merchant.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Storefront​Access​Token

You can use the StorefrontAccessToken resource to generate storefront access tokens. Storefront access tokens are used to delegate unauthenticated access scopes to clients that need to access the unautheticated Storefront API. A sales channel can generate a storefront access token and then pass it to a consuming client, such as JavaScript or a mobile application.

Note

Storefront access tokens are allocated on a per shop basis, and an application can have a maximum of 100 active Storefront access tokens per shop.

A storefront access token inherits all of the [unauthenticated access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api/access-scopes) from the app that creates it. If the app has not been granted any unauthenticated access scopes, then creating the storefront access token will fail.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Tender​Transaction

Requires `orders` access scope.

Each tender transaction represents money passing between the merchant and a customer. A tender transaction with a positive amount represents a transaction where the customer paid money to the merchant. A negative amount represents a transaction where the merchant refunded money back to the customer. Tender transactions represent transactions that modify the shop's balance.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Theme

Requires `themes` access scope.

A theme controls the look and feel of a Shopify online store.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/theme.png)

A store can have a maximum of 20 themes, one of which is the published theme that customers see when they visit the online store. Customers can't see unpublished themes. When you publish a theme, the previously published theme becomes unpublished.

To modify theme files after they're uploaded, use the [Asset](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/online-store/asset) resource. To learn how to create your own theme, refer to [*Building themes*](https://shopify.dev/concepts/themes)

Requires ANY of the following access scopes: `orders`, `marketplace_orders`.

Transactions are created for every order that results in an exchange of money.

![](https://shopify.dev/assets/api/reference/transaction.png)

There are five types of transactions:

* **Authorization**: An amount reserved against the cardholder's funding source. Money does not change hands until the authorization is captured.
* **Sale**: An authorization and capture performed together in a single step.
* **Capture**: A transfer of the money that was reserved during the authorization stage.
* **Void**: A cancellation of a pending authorization or capture.
* **Refund**: A partial or full return of captured funds to the cardholder. A refund can happen only after a capture is processed.

Refund transactions must be created by using the [Refund resource](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/orders/refund).

Note

An order can have more than one authorization transaction associated with it. This might happen when an order is edited or when a post-purchase upsell is added to the order. To be notified when an order is edited subscribe to the OrderEdit webhook.

If your app captures payments, you should make a `GET` request to the `/admin/api/{version}/orders/{order_id}/transactions.json` endpoint to retrieve the authorization transactions associated with an order. Then, to complete the full order payment capture, you should use the `authorization` or `parent_id` properties in separate capture `POST` requests to the same endpoint for each authorization transaction.

Note

An order can have no more than 100 transactions associated with it.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Transactions

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Usage​Charge

You can use the UsageCharge resource to add variable usage fees to an existing [recurring application charge](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/billing/recurringapplicationcharge). You can use these resources to support billing plans that vary from month to month, with or without a monthly recurring fee.

## Creating usage charges

To use the UsageCharge resource, first create a [recurring application charge](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/billing/recurringapplicationcharge). This returns the ID that you'll need to create an associated usage charge.

To create the usage charge, send a POST request, where `{id}` represents the ID of the previously created recurring application charge.

```
POST
```

/admin/recurring\_application\_charges/{id}/usage\_charges.json

### Charging for usage only

A common billing scenario is to charge only usage-based fees, without a flat recurring monthly fee. To charge only usage-based fees without a recurring monthly fee, first create a [recurring application charge](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/billing/recurringapplicationcharge/) with a price of $0.00 and then apply the usage charge.

You need to include the `capped_amount` and `terms` properties in the body of your request when you create a recurring application charge with a price of $0.00.

## Setting capped amounts

You can use the RecurringApplicationCharge resource to specify a capped amount that applies to usage-based billing. This prevents the customer from being charged for any usage over and above the capped amount. To implement capped amount billing, create a recurring application charge with the capped dollar amount, and then create the associated usage charge.

Note

The capped amount setting is applicable on a per billing cycle basis (30 days), and remains in effect unless updated.

For step-by-step guidance that walks through this flow using examples, see our [implementation guide](https://shopify.dev/apps/billing/models).

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# User

Requires `users` access scope.

#### Shopify Plus

The User resource is available for [private apps](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps#private-apps) and [custom apps](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps#custom-apps) installed on **[Shopify Plus](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/intro-to-shopify/pricing-plans/shopify-plus)** stores. You need to contact Shopify Plus Support to request the `read_users` [access scope](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for your app.

The User resource lets you retrieve information about staff on a Shopify shop, including [staff permissions](https://help.shopify.com/manual/your-account/staff-accounts/staff-permissions).

Permissions determine the level of access that staff have to a merchant's store. From the Shopify admin, merchants can give each staff individual permissions that control access to a part of Shopify. The API only lets you retrieve information about staff.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Webhook

You can use webhook subscriptions to receive notifications about particular events in a shop. After you've subscribed to a webhook topic, your app can execute code immediately after specific events occur in shops that have your app installed, instead of having to make API calls periodically to check their status.

For example, you can rely on webhooks to trigger an action in your app when a customer creates a cart, or when a merchant creates a new product in their Shopify admin. By using webhooks, you can make fewer API calls overall, which makes sure that your apps are more efficient and update quickly.

For more information on how webhooks work and how to test them, refer to [Webhooks overview](https://shopify.dev/apps/webhooks) and [Webhook testing](https://shopify.dev/apps/webhooks#testing-webhooks).

### Considerations

If you create a webhook subscription through the Shopify admin, then that subscription won't be returned in API calls. These webhook subscriptions are associated solely to the shop, so the API can't access them.

Webhook subscriptions are scoped only to the app that they're registered to. This means that when a webhook subscription is registered to an app, other apps can't view, modify, or delete it.

To learn how to verify webhooks, refer to [Verify the webhook](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/configure-https-endpoints#step-5-verify-the-webhook).

***

### Mandatory webhooks

Apps must subscribe to certain webhooks topics. You create [mandatory webhooks](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/privacy-law-compliance#mandatory-compliance-webhooks) either via the [Partner Dashboard](https://shopify.dev/apps/webhooks/configuration/mandatory-webhooks#subscribe-to-privacy-webhooks) or by updating the [app configuration TOML](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli/configuration#app-configuration-file-example).

| Topic | Event |
| - | - |
| `customers/data_request` | Requests to view stored customer data |
| `customers/redact` | Requests to delete customer data |
| `shop/redact` | Requests to delete shop data |
